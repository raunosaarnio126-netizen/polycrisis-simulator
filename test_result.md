# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

New ScenarioAmendment model with optional fields allows partial updates. PATCH endpoint only updates provided fields, solving the 'update failed' issue. All test data from review request (Finland, Sweden, Estonia regions; GDP Growth, Employment Rate, Trade Balance variables; Nordic Council stakeholders; 6-12 months timeline) processed correctly.

Tested multiple detection strategies (role='dialog', data-state='open', modal classes) but no dialog appears.

Console logs now appear: 'Floating Genie button clicked, current state: false' and 'State should now be true'. ✅ DIALOG Z-INDEX WORKING: DialogContent z-[10000] ensures proper layering above all other elements. ✅ BUTTON CLICKABILITY: JavaScript click method works perfectly (page.evaluate('button.click()')) - this bypasses the Emergent badge overlay issue. ✅ DEBUG INDICATOR: Green 'Genie Dialog State: OPEN' indicator appears in top-right when clicked, confirming state management working. ✅ DIALOG OPENING: AI Genie dialog modal opens and displays correctly with proper title 'AI Avatar Genie (Floating)'. ✅ DIALOG INTERACTION: Input field accepts text, Send button is enabled and functional, AI Genie interface fully interactive. ✅ DIALOG CLOSING: Dialog closes properly by clicking outside (onOpenChange working). Minor: Emergent badge still overlaps (both have z-index 9999) but JavaScript click bypasses this limitation.

Final input shows 'emergencyresponseriskassessmentteamcoordination' (spaces and commas removed). 2) ALL THREE COMMA-SEPARATED FIELDS AFFECTED: Specializations field, Knowledge Domains field, and Task Capabilities field all exhibit the same issue - commas are detected but not preserved in the input value. 3) VISUAL FEEDBACK SHOWS INCORRECT PARSING: Visual feedback displays '[emergencyresponseriskassessmentteamcoordination]' instead of the expected comma-separated array. ✅ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The debugging console logs show that comma key presses are detected correctly ('Key pressed: ,' and 'Comma key detected!' messages appear), but the input field value does not retain the comma characters. This suggests an issue with the input field's onChange handler or the way the value is being processed and displayed.

Results: 7/10 tests passed (70% success rate). ✅ DEBUGGING FEATURES WORKING: Console logging, onKeyDown handlers, and comma detection all working correctly. Comma key presses are detected and logged properly. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED: Comma characters are NOT preserved in input field values. When typing comma-separated text, the commas are detected but removed from the input field, resulting in concatenated text without spaces or commas. This affects all three fields: Specializations, Knowledge Domains, and Task Capabilities. ✅ FORM SUBMISSION: Despite the comma issue, form submission works and avatar creation is successful. The issue is specifically with comma character preservation in the input fields during typing. ROOT CAUSE: The input field's onChange handler or value processing is removing comma characters, preventing proper comma-separated input functionality. The debugging implementation is working correctly and helps identify this issue."

Users can type naturally with commas and spaces. Visual feedback displays parsed values with pipe separators (e.g., 'emergency response | risk assessment | team coordination'). Form submission works correctly with proper array data sent to backend. Field clearing functionality works properly when form is reset. ✅ SPECIFIC TEST RESULTS: Specializations field: 'emergency response, risk assessment, team coordination' → preserved correctly, parsed as 'emergency response | risk assessment | team coordination'. Knowledge Domains field: 'emergency management, public safety, logistics' → preserved correctly, parsed as 'emergency management | public safety | logistics'.
